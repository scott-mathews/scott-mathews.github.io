          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
          I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with both a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science in 2018, and joined Microsoft full time as a Software Engineer. With the Microsoft MSAI team in the Office organization, my work focuses on bridging the gap between advances in Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing/Speech Recognition and the existing state of Office products. From building voice-enabled services for Cortana, to integrating advances in natural language processing into Outlook's search capabilities, I have a breadth of experience creating and maintaining intelligence-based features for large audiences.
